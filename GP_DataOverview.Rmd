### Data Overview

In this project, there are sets of different datasets that we processed and analyzed. As a general overview, this project focuses on two categories of data: Markers and Possible Influencers. 

Marker data is essentially the most necessary data needed to grasp the current popularity and distribution of golf players. This includes datasets of junior boys and girls within the nation. 

Possible influencer data contains datasets of information that might have an effect on the popularity of golf within an area to some degree. These datasets include median household income, number of existing golf courses, and weather by state level. The point of these datasets are to compare them to the population distribution of golf players in order to gauge their influence on popularity.

In this project, we analyzed the data by first processing them into maps of the US separated by the state level and then visually comparing the maps in order to gauge the connection and degree certain data has with golf popularity. When comparing maps, it should be noted that the more maps display similar spatial densities of information, the more directly related the datasets are. Conversely, if maps display opposite spatial densities, then the data is inversely related to each other. The more extreme the similarity or reversal of spatial information, the more they are related to each other. However, if the maps' spatial densities show no certain patterns and seem to be completely random, then that would imply no correlation between the data.
